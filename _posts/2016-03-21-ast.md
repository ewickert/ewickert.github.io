title: Abstract Syntax Trees

# 1. Introduction
I have proposed moving from PAXIX's current style of direct code generation to
an AST based model. The AST model has a number of advantages over our current 
method. I will first explain a little about the advantages we will gain, then
discuss how such a system could best be implemented.

# 2. Advantages

## 2.1. Optimization
The first advantage, and the one which I cannot give examples of, is the
ability to optimize the code generated by our compiler. The PAXIC currently does
not have any kind of intermediate representation. Our ability to perform 
operations on the generated source code is limited. It would require another 
parser to read the generated machine code and re order the instructions.

## 2.2. Multiple Pass Compilation
The most evident of the advantages gained with this architecture shift is the 
ability to pass over the program to be compiled multiple times. For instance,
we can add all procedure entries to the symbol table before they need to be 
checked. The given paxi program results in a compilation error:

	proc main()
		foo()
		bar()
	endproc

	proc foo()
		writestr("Hello ");
	endproc

	proc bar()
		writestr("World!");
		line;
	endproc


This is because `foo()` and `bar()` are called before they are defined. PAXIX, 
much like C, currently requires methods to be defined before use. However, this 
isn't a necessary handicap. This program could be represented with this syntax
tree:

![Example 1](/assets/example1.png)

Once the program is represented as a tree, it is easy to traverse the tree as
far as the `procedure_decl` nodes. These nodes can be parsed to add their 
information to the symbol table. The next compilation pass can work with the 
knowledge that all of the procedures that can be called are already present in 
the symbol table[^1].

# 3. Implementation

## 3.1. Data Structure

Bison maintains an implicit syntax tree. We need to have an explicit one in
order to traverse it effectively. The best way to do that is through a tree made
of linked structs. There are 3 different implementations that would achieve our 
requirements. All of these implemenations require a struct for each of the 
productions that will appear in the AST.

### 3.1.1. C Polymorphism

A fairly common design pattern it is possible to make "substructs" in C. Our
base implementation might look like this:

~~~
typedef struct{
	ast_node** children;
} ast_node;

typedef struct{
	ast_node base;
	char* id;
} ast_procedure_decl_node;
~~~
{: .language-c}

This structure has the benefit of allowing us to use the base ast_node whenever
we need it. The drawback to this system is that there will be lots of casting
and it may be harder to make sure that our nodes are the correct type when we
want them to be.

### 3.1.2. Seperate structs

The second possible implementation requires a unique struct for each of the
productions in the language, and specific naming of the children for each node:

~~~
	typedef struct{
		ast_node_globals_list* globals_list;
		ast_node_procedure_list* procedure_list;
	} ast_node_program;

	typedef struct{
		ast_node_globals_decl** globals_decls;
	} ast_node_globals_list;
~~~
{: .language-c }

This implemementation is useful because our C functions can call on the specific
kind of struct we are using, and because we can guarantee the values that our
structs are going to have. 

### 3.1.3. Other

The third option is probably the least appealing, and so I will only mention it 
briefly. Given a single kind of struct with an enum field we can check the
type of node at run time by comparing the enum values.

## 3.2. Creating the tree

Currently, our parser generates raw PVM assembly:

~~~
	quantity: variable{
		emit(27, 500, 0);
		emit(3, 500, 500);
		emit(24, 500, 0);
	}

	...

	variable: ID_TOKEN{
		...
	}
~~~
{: .language-c}

When generating an AST we will instead generate nodes and pass them back up the
tree to be attached at a later point:

~~~
	quantity: variable{
		ast_quantity_node* new = malloc(sizeof(ast_quantity_node));
		new -> variable = $1;
		$$ = new;
	}

	...

	variable: ID_TOKEN{
		ast_variable_node* new = malloc(sizeof(ast_variable_node));
		new -> id = $<sval>1
		$$ = new;
	}
~~~
{: .language-c}

This way, by the time we get back up to the `<program>` production, we will
wind up returning a pointer to the root node for the whole tree.

## 3.3. Generating Code

Once the AST has been generated, creating code from it is as easy as doing a 
tree traversal. Each unit of the tree can be cleanly subdivided into it's 
component nodes. The globals list can be be generated one node at a time, and
then the functions list. Generation will move the emitting of instructions out of the 
parser and into an outside module. For the most part the code generation will be 
the same:

~~~
	generate_quantity(ast_quantity_node* node){
		if(node -> variable != null){
			printf("Load variable address");
			printf("Load variable value");
			printf("Push variable on stack");
		} else if (node -> call != null){
			generate-call(node -> call);
		} else if (node -> int != null){
			printf("Push node -> int to stack");
		} else if (node -> char != null){
			printf("Push node -> char to stack");
		}
	}
~~~
{: .language-c }

[^1]: Paxi currently requires a location for procedure calls, while switching 
	to amd64, this will no longer be necessary: jumps can be to labels instead of
	memory locations.
