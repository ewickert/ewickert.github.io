# Paxix [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/carl-walker/paxix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/carl-walker/paxix)
[Github](https://github.com/carl-walker/paxix)

Paxix is a compiler for an extended version of the Paxi programming language 
created by Prof. David Nordstrom at George Mason University. Paxix started as our
class project, and we kept adding features to it, even after graduation.

# Vim-paxix

# Event Horizon [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ewickert/event-horizon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ewickert/event-horizon)
[Github](https://github.com/ewickert/event-horizon)
[Playable demo](https://ewickert.github.io/event-horizon)

Event Horizon is the first HTML5 game I built for a game design class my senior
year of college. The idea was to have a physics based arcade game that brought
back of the fun of retro, high-score driven games.

# MiniEditor
[Github](https://github.com/ewickert/event-horizon)

The first project I ever did with typescript. I was interested in building a 
WYSIWYG html editor and wanted to see how hard it would be to implement it myself.
I used this project to teach myself about the Node.js toolchain and better Javascript
in general. MiniEditor was based off of [TinyEditor](http://www.scriptiny.com/2010/02/javascript-wysiwyg-editor/).
